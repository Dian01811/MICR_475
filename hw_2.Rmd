I wanted to investigate the mpg for highway driving which appeared most frequently in the popular models in 1999 and 2008.
 

```{r setup_workspace, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)

```

```{r our_first_plot, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + 
  geom_histogram()

```

This plot suggests that the mpg for highway driving which appeared most frequently in the popular models in 1999 and 2008 is about **26**.
