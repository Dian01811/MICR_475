The data named "Ionic Radius" is mapped to the x axis

The data named "Partition Coefficient" is mapped to the y axis. The data is continuous with log-transformation

The data are displayed using both points and lines

The unsuccessful plot is because the points, lines and characters in the figure overlap to varying degrees, and the range of numbers each axis covers is too large, which affects our judgment of the relative relationship of the data.
