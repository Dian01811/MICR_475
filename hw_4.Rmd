Part 1
```{r}
#########
# Print the sum of a and b
#########
a <- 3 # Assign the value 3 to a variable called a
b <- 2 # Assign the value 3 to a variable called a
(a+b) 
```
Part 2
```{r}
#########
# Calculate sum of 2 and 3 using the sum() function

a <- 3
b <- 2
sum(a+b)
```
Part 3
```{r setup_workspace, message=FALSE}

Part 4
```{r our_first_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#########
# Make a scatter plot about the departure delay vs. arrival delay
#########
AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA")
#view(AA_flights)
ggplot(data = AA_flights) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) #make a scatter plot by mapping the departure delay vs. arrival delay
